# Cicada 3301

[Cicada 3301](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicada_3301) is the name given to a mysterious organization that posted a series of complex puzzles online, starting in 2012. The enigmatic puzzles focused on cryptography, data security, steganography and internet anonymity. Spanning many forms of media including websites, phone numbers, original music, digital images and physical locations around the world, they drew in thousands attempting to solve them.

I was sucked into this recently and found a great 4-part documentary series on YouTube by A Great Big Story. The videos are unlisted for some reason, though. So here are the links to all four parts:
