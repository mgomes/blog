# What I'm Doing Now

(This is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page.)

## 3xo

I'm building a desktop app to orchestrate work between humans and AI agents. It uses a kanban interface to visualize the flow.

The [website](https://3xo.ai) is live, and I have CI/CD working for macOS and Linux builds. The app itself is currently horribly buggy, but I will announce here when it's stable enough for testers.

## The Stack

I'm currently betting on [Wails](https://wails.io). The build sizes are refreshing compared to Electron.

This has forced me to dive deeper into [Go](https://go.dev). While I still miss the expressiveness of Ruby, Go's tooling and simplicity are winning me over.

## Questions

AI is about to make software creation trivial, which leads to logistics questions that occupy my mind:

- Where will all this micro-software run?
- Who will own the data?
- How do we operate a world with 100x more software but the same number of engineers?
