# What I'm Doing Now

(This is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page.)

## Vibescript

I'm currently building an embedded programming language called [Vibescript](https://github.com/mgomes/vibesript). It's designed to be used in vibe coded environments. It's memory and compute can be completely controlled by the embeddor. It's written and Go and designed to be as expressive as Ruby.

I'm having a lot of fun with this.

## The Stack

I'm currently betting on [Wails](https://wails.io). The build sizes are refreshing compared to Electron.

This has forced me to dive deeper into [Go](https://go.dev). While I still miss the expressiveness of Ruby, Go's tooling and simplicity are winning me over.

## Questions

AI is about to make software creation trivial, which leads to logistics questions that occupy my mind:

- Where will all this micro-software run?
- Who will own the data?
- How do we operate a world with 100x more software but the same number of engineers?
