# Introducing Stealth

After eight months of development, I'm excited to announce the official launch of [Stealth](https://hellostealth.org). Stealth is an open source Ruby framework for creating conversational voice and text chatbots.

Back in August 2017, [Matthew Black](https://whoisblackops.com) and I started imagining a better way to build chatbots. We wanted a framework that included:

* **Support for any messaging service**. If a service wasnâ€™t yet supported, it shouldnâ€™t be difficult to add it in.
* **Support for the all of the great NLP/NLU tools being released**. Again, if one wasnâ€™t supported, it should be easy to add in.
* **Use your own code editor**. The ability to create chatbots using your favorite code editor.
* **Easy handling of common scenarios**. For example, chatbots will sometimes fail to understand users and so handling those scenarios should be baked in (we call them Catch Alls).
* **Deployable anywhere**. We should be able to take advantage of all the great cloud services available.
* **Open source**. We believe deeply that all frameworks and databases should be open source.
* **Support for popular databases**. We wanted to use the great SQL and NoSQL databases that are already available.
* **Support for developer tooling**. We wanted to use continuous integration services like CircleCI and Travis, GitHub, Heroku Pipelines, etc.
* **Testing**. If chatbots are to become first class pieces of software, they need to have testing built-in.

With all of those goals in mind, we decided to create an open source, Ruby framework. We chose the Ruby language not only because itâ€™s our favorite, but also because of the diverse community and rich libraries (gems) available. We even modeled a lot of Stealth around [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org).

In addition to all of the great things already provided by Ruby and Rails (ActiveRecord, ActiveSupport, Sidekiq, Sinatra, RSpec, Bundler, wide support, etc.) we also added a few specific things that make building Ruby chatbots with Stealth fun and easy.

Since Stealth is an MVC-architected framework, we had to design our own View layer. We call them [Replies](https://hellostealth.org/docs/#replies). Replies are YAML templates that support ERB. Regardless of which messaging platform your bot is connected to, replies are standardized. This means that connecting your bot to a new network can be as trivial as adding a new gem.

We also built our own concept of [sessions](https://hellostealth.org/docs/#sessions). Sessions in Stealth are Redis-backed and they map users to positions within your bot. We call those positions *flows* and *states*. You can think of flows and states as lightweight state machines. More info about both are in our [Getting Started](https://hellostealth.org/docs/#the_basics.flows) guide.

Lastly, we designed best practices right into the framework. By default, bots come with three flows: **Hello**, **Goodbye**, and **CatchAll**. The *hello* and *goodbye* flows handle user entrances and exits. The *catch_all* flow is responsible for errors and for the times your bot fails to comprehend a userâ€™s message. You can think of the *catch_all* flow as our advanced version of the `HTTP 500` error page. The `catch_all` flow is capable of re-asking questions, routing users to different flows, and even handing off a conversation to a human operator. More info about `catch_all`â€™s can be found [in our documentation](https://hellostealth.org/docs/#catch_all).

We are releasing [version 1.0](https://github.com/hellostealth/stealth) today and it contains support for everything mentioned above. Additionally, version 1.0 comes with official support for Facebook Messenger and SMS (via Twilio). It also supports [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com) analytics and the [AWS Comprehend](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/) NLP/NLU service.

We hope you love building chatbots with Stealth, and we canâ€™t wait to see what you build. We already have so many more features and service integrations planned, but we welcome your feedback and pull requests! ðŸ¤–
