Summary: A depth-first vs breadth-first search visualizer

# Maze Solving

I built [a little maze solving tool](https://fun.mauriciogomes.com/maze-solver/index.html) to help visualize the difference between [depth-first search (DFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) and [breadth-first search (BFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search).

## Why I built this

So many problems on LeetCode and HackerRank can be solved with these algorithms, and AI coding agents make it easy to build interactive learning tools like this one.

I hope the takeaway here isn't just how DFS and BFS work (if you didn't already know), but that AI coding agents can serve as tutors capable of creating tailored study experiences.
